A web scraper is software used to collect information from the web
# About the project
I created this basic web scraper to get information about products in an e-commerce website. I used https://www.jumia.cm/en/mobile-phones?page2 for this project. The project has a basic interface that runs at the terminal 

# Goals of the project

- Managing the files with correct usage to make ensure code maintainability.
- Git Flow and Github Flow creating branches for different features and for version control.
- Rspec for testing parts of the code.

Open the terminal and install bundler by typing the command gem install bundler on the terminal. After installing bundler, navigate(change directory) to the folder containing the files you've cloned and typed the command bundle install on the terminal to install the necessary gems to run the scraper.

You will need to execute the scraper file located inside the bin folder. If you are using Window, follow the next step.
